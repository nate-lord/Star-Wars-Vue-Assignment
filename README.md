## Exercise

You client is looking to improve their site which is shows two pages, <a href="/people">People</a>  and <a href="/vehicles">Vehicles</a>.

However the client is looking for a way of better understanding both the people and vehicles in aggregate; and also the relation between the two.

Your task:
1. On the <a href="/people/1">Person</a> page the client wants to see a list of vehicles associated with that person where applicable
2. We need a visualization on the <a href="">home</a> page which shows the relation between **mass** and **height** for all people.
    1. The relationship should be easy to interpret
    2. It should be visually appealing
    3. This is no limitation on libraries or ways of visualizing this
    4. *Bonus if you can drill down to a person (link to Person page)*
3. The client isn't happy with the current style of their site and would like to improve it. They are open to almost any changes but have two requirements that must be met:
    1. The site should be responsive at least down to the form factor of an iPhone (note that it currently is not entirely responsive)
    2. It must use the below color palette, graphics can use other colors as long as they fit in with the main site:
      * <span style="font-weight:700; color:#2081f9">Blue</span> #2081f9
      * <span style="font-weight:700; color:#ffffff; background:#000">White</span> #ffffff
      * <span style="font-weight:700; color:#f99820">Orange </span> #f99820
      * <span style="font-weight:700; color:#bbbbbb">Grey</span> #bbbbbb
      * <span style="font-weight:700; color:#09264a">Navy</span> #09264a
